# Safety-Critical Control with Bounded Inputs: A Closed-Form Solution for Backup Control Barrier Functions
*Abstract*: Verifying the safety of controllers is critical for many applications, but is especially challenging for systems with bounded inputs. Backup control barrier functions (bCBFs) offer a structured approach to synthesizing safe controllers that are guaranteed to satisfy input bounds by leveraging the knowledge of a backup controller. While powerful, bCBFs require solving a high-dimensional quadratic program at run-time, which may be too costly for computationally-constrained systems such as aerospace vehicles. We propose an approach that optimally interpolates between a nominal controller and the backup controller, and we derive the solution to this optimization problem in closed-form. We prove that this closed-form controller is guaranteed to be safe while obeying input bounds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a double integrator and a nonlinear fixed-wing aircraft example.
